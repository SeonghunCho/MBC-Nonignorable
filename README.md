The variable of interest $Y$ is the body fat percentage measured by *dxa*(dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, variable `DXDTOPF`). The demographics data include *age*(variable `RIDAGEYR`, $8 \le \mathit{age} \le 59$) and *gender*(variable `RIAGENDR`, 1 for male and 2 for female), and the examination data include *bmi*(body mass index, variable `BMXBMI`).
