## Data

### Abstract

The dataset used for the analyses in Section 7 of the paper is from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017â€“2018,
a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status
of adults and children in the United States.

### Availability 

The dataset is available for download at <www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm>.

### Description

The variable of interest $Y$ is the body fat percentage measured by *dxa*
(dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, variable `DXDTOPF`). The demographics
data include *age*(variable `RIDAGEYR`, $8 \le \mathit{age} \le 59$) and
*gender*(variable `RIAGENDR`, 1 for male and 2 for female), and the
examination data include *bmi*(body mass index, variable `BMXBMI`). There
are $n = 5,055$ subjects and 1,411 (27.9\%) of which have missing $Y$ values.

## Code

### Abstract

All of the simulation study and the case study for this paper were done in R.
Separate code files are provided to conduct two simulation studies and analysis
on real data sets for the case study.

### Description

All of the R scripts used in this paper are available in this project.
